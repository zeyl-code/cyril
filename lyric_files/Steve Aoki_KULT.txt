[Verse 1: grandson]
I got the weight of the world on my back
And it made me slip right through the cracks
It caused a chain reaction
Now I escape to a world here with you
Up is down, red is blue
We see through all the distraction

[Chorus: grandson]
Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
That the world's a fucking circus
That my life feels fucking worthless
Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
When it all comes crashing down
We'll see who's laughing
Now
Now

[Verse 2: Jasiah]
Maybe you should join a circus
So you see just what your worth is
In your palace of lost battles
How could you be so judgemental?
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me
How you won't accept no more apologies
I don't want to understand you'Cause I know you would stand on me



[Chorus: grandson]
Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
That the world's a fucking circus
That my life feels fucking worthless
Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
When it all comes crashing down
We'll see who's laughing
Now
Now

[Bridge: grandson]
Maybe it's not a conspiracy
And it's nothing but coincidence
Maybe there's some possibility
That I'm not insignificant
Maybe I've been getting brainwashed
But here I get to take off
The face I hide behind

[Chorus: grandson]
Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
That the world's a fucking circus
That my life feels fucking worthless
Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
When it all comes crashing down
We'll see who's laughing
Now
Now
Now
